But\nfirst, since I had been writing code that day, I pushed the latest\nversion to the server.  As long as I was going to have to restart\nHN, I might as well get a fresh version.<p>After I restarted HN, the problem was still there.  So I guessed\nthe problem must be due to something in the code I'd written that\nday, and tried reverting to the previous version, and restarting the\nserver again.  But the problem was still there.  Then we (because\nby this point I'd managed to get hold of Nick Sivo, YC's hacker in\nresidence) tried reverting to the version of HN that was on the old\nserver, and that didn't work either.  We knew that code had worked\nfine, so we figured the problem must be with the new server.  So\nwe tried to switch back to the old server.  I don't know if Nick\nsucceeded, because in the middle of this I gave up and went to bed.<p>When I woke up this morning, Rtm had HN running on the new server.\nThe bad thread was still there, but it had been pushed off the\nfrontpage by newer stuff.  So HN as a whole wasn't dying, but there\nwere still signs something was amiss, e.g.  that /threads?id=pg\ndidn't work, because of the comment I made on the thread with the\nloop in it.<p>Eventually Rtm noticed that the problem seemed to be related to a\ncertain item id.  When I looked at the item on disk I realized what\nmust have happened.<p>So I did some more surgery in the repl, this time more carefully,\nand everything seems fine now.<p>Sorry about that.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}}],"nbHits":632,"page":0,"nbPages":632,"hitsPerPage":1,"processingTimeMS":3,"query":"","params":"advancedSyntax=true&analytics=false&hitsPerPage=1&tags=%28story%29%2Cauthor_pg"}},{"url":"/api/v1/search_by_date?hitsPerPage=1&tags=(story)%2Cauthor_pg","reply":{"hits":[{"created_at":"2014-03-29T20:43:24.000Z","title":"Meet the People Taking over Hacker News","url":"http://blog.ycombinator.com/meet-the-people-taking-over-hacker-news","author":"pg","points":578,"story_text":"","comment_text":null,"num_comments":290,"story_id":null,"story_title":null,"story_url":null,"parent_id":null,"created_at_i":1396125804,"_tags":["story","author_pg","story_7493856"],"objectID":"7493856","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"Meet the People Taking over Hacker News","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"url":{"value":"http://blog.ycombinator.com/meet-the-people-taking-over-hacker-news","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"author":{"value":"pg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_text":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}}],"nbHits":632,"page":0,"nbPages":632,"hitsPerPage":1,"processingTimeMS":3,"query":"","params":"advancedSyntax=true&analytics=false&hitsPerPage=1&tags=%28story%29%2Cauthor_pg"}},{"url":"/api/v1/search?hitsPerPage=1&tags=(comment)&query=apple","reply":{"hits":[{"created_at":"2013-11-01T05:18:12.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"pg","points":293,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"It&#x27;s a little early to say for sure, but I predict this will do more to hurt Apple&#x27;s reputation in the tech community than anything they&#x27;ve done before.
